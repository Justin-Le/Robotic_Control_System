# Robotic_Control_System

##An obstacle-avoiding BeagleBone vehicle.##

The purpose of the mathematical model is to simulate the system in MATLAB/Simulink in the future. The control algorithm is based on PID and implemented in C++ using Derek Molloy's exploringBB library. Will switch to Python soon.
